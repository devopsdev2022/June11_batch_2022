1. docker search
#We can use the command docker search to search for public images on the Docker hub. It will return information about the image name, description, stars, official and automated.
If you prefer a GUI-based search option, use the Docker Hub website.


docker search MySQL



2. docker pull
Now that we know the name of the image, we can pull that from the Docker hub using the command docker pull. Here, we are setting the platform option as well.

docker pull ubuntu

3. docker images
command to list all the local images.


docker images


4. docker run
Run the docker image mentioned in the command. This command will create a docker container in which the Apache HTTP server will run. Moreover, we can use the --name option to assign a name to the container. Docker will randomly assign a name if we don’t provide one.


docker run -it ubuntu bash
docker run -dt http

5. docker ps
We can list all the running containers by using the following command.

docker ps

How about listing all the containers, including stopped once? We can do that by adding --all option.

docker ps --all

6. docker stop
To stop a container, use the docker stop command with either the container id or container name. We may stop a container if we want to change our docker run command.

docker stop <container id>
7. docker restart
Let’s restart our stopped contained by using the following command. We may want to use this after we reboot our machine.

docker restart <container id>

8. docker rename
change the name to keep track of our containers more easily.

docker rename <existing-name> <new_name>

9. docker exec
Access the docker container and run commands inside the container. I am accessing the apache server container in this example.

docker exec -it <container id> bash

10. docker logs
This command is helpful to debug our Docker containers. It will fetch logs from a specified container.
docker logs <container name>


11. docker rm
In case we want to remove a container, we can use the following command.

docker rm <container name>

You may encounter an error like
Error response from daemon: You cannot remove a running container ……… Stop the container before attempting removal or force remove
As it recommends, we can stop the container first and then remove it or use option -f to remove a running container forcefully.

docker stop <container name>

docker rm test_db

# or
docker rm -f test_db


12. docker rmi

use the docker rmi command with the image id to remove an image.
docker rmi <image name>


13. Docker restart


Restart the docker container with container id 

docker restart <container id>


14. Docker start

This command in docker starts the docker container with container id 

docker start <container id>


15. Docker commit

Save a new docker image with container id mentioned in the command on the local system. 

docker commit <comtainer id> <image name> 

16.docker login

Login into docker hub. You will be asked your docker hub credentials to log in.

docker login

17. Docker push 
Upload a docker image with the image name mentioned in the command on the dockerhub.

docker push <image name>
